1. Incorrect method declarations

The LinkedList class has errors in method declarations and definitions (push, append, insert).
Some methods are not complete (push(int value) is not fully written).
In insert, the new_node variable is not declared, but n_n is used instead, which causes a compilation error.

2. The append method should add a new node to the end of the list, but after declaring the new node (n_n), the code exits (return;) if first_elem is not nullptr. However, when appending to a non-empty list, the logic breaks.

3. The code does not free the memory allocated via new , which leads to leaks.

4. LinkedList does not have a destructor, which leads to memory leaks when the list object is deleted.
